    * @brief A lock-free, fixed-capacity ring buffer for concurrent data access.
    *
    * This class provides a circular buffer that supports atomic, index-based access
    * to elements using `std::atomic<T>`. It offers low-level building blocks for
    * concurrent data structures, but does not implement coordination or synchronization.
    *
    * The buffer assumes power-of-two capacity and uses index wrapping to stay within bounds.
    * All element accesses use relaxed memory ordering, which supports atomic operations
    * but does not enforce ordering or synchronization between threads.
    *
    * This class does not throw exceptions. Allocation failure during
    * resizing is reported via a std::expected return value.
    *
    * @note This class is a low-level storage primitive and does not:
    * - Coordinate access between producers and consumers
    * - Enforce memory ordering (e.g., acquire/release semantics)
    * - Prevent data overwrites (e.g., multiple writers to the same index)
    * - Track ownership or validity of indices
    *
    * @tparam T The element type, which must be trivially copyable and compatible with std::atomic.
